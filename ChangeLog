	* Headers/QuartzCore/CALayer.h:
	Added sublayerTransform property.

	* Source/CAAnimation.m:
	Added default value for repeatCount property.

	* Source/CALayer.m:
	Added sublayerTransform property and support for animation's
	repeatCount property (preventing removal if animation is
	repeating). Property 'autoreverses' doubles the time needed
	for the animation.

	* Source/CARenderer.m:
	Added support for sublayers.

	* Tests/hello_animation.m:
	Testing of the sublayerTransform property. Changed some
	positions and angles to make things more visible.

	* Headers/QuartzCore/CAMediaTiming.h:
	* Source/CAAnimation.m:
	* Source/CALayer.m:
	* Source/CARenderer.m:
	* Tests/hello_animation.m:
	Rework of timing model, introducing frame begin time, and
	approximating behavior when frame begin time doesn't match
	CACurrentMediaTime(). It's not highly important to match
	it exactly, as it doesn't seem like it should be used with
	Cocoa implementation either (if one passes, e.g.,
	CACurrentMediaTime()-1, animations are delayed, but time
	conversion methods are unaffected).
	
	Some methods have been moved to CAMediaTiming protocol which
	ordinarily don't belong there.

	Time conversion functions, for converting between layers,
	have been implemented.

	* Headers/QuartzCore/CALayer.h:
	Added some private methods for traversing the layer tree.

	* GSQuartzCore.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:
	* Headers/QuartzCore/AppleSupport.h:
	* Headers/QuartzCore/AppleSupportRevert.h:
	* Source/CAMediaTiming.m:
	Added CAMediaTiming.m, containing definitions for fillmode
	constants. Under Cocoa, turned on building of 32-bit code,
	in order to approach feature-set of older GNU runtimes and
	compilers, making writing non-portable code easier to spot.

	* Headers/QuartzCore/CAAnimation.h:
	* Headers/QuartzCore/CALayer.h:
	* Headers/QuartzCore/CAMediaTiming.h:
	* Headers/QuartzCore/CARenderer.h:
	* Source/CAAnimation.m:
	* Source/CALayer.m:
	* Source/CARenderer.m:
	Added support for presentation layers and animations.
	Added some missing -dealloc methods. Corrected CAMediaTiming
	protocol by adding missing properties.

	* Tests/GNUstepQuartzCoreTests.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:
	Under Cocoa, turned on building of 32-bit code, in order
	to approach feature-set of older GNU runtimes and compilers,
	making writing non-portable code easier to spot.

	* Tests/hello_animation.m:
	Added testing of sublayers. Some code for figuring out
	correct behavior of time conversion. Some new animation
	tests.

	* Source/CABackingStore.m:
	Added implementation of -dealloc.
	
	* Source/CABase.m:
	Added mach-based implementation of CACurrentMediaTime() in
	order to get the same results as under Cocoa. Regular UNIX
	implementation still used under non-Mach platforms.
	
	* Source/CAValueFunction.m:
	* Headers/QuartzCore/CAValueFunction.h:
	Added stub of CAValueFunction class.

	* Tests/hello_animation-Info.plist:
	* Tests/hello_animation.m:
	* Tests/GNUmakefile:
	Added a new test, hello_animation, demonstrating and testing 
	use of animations.
	
	* Headers/QuartzCore/CALayer.h:
	* Source/CALayer.m:
	Added support for presentation and model layers. Began adding
	animation functions.

	* Headers/QuartzCore/AppleSupport.h:
	* Headers/QuartzCore/AppleSupportRevert.h:
	* Source/CALayer.m:
	* Source/GNUmakefile:
	Added CABackingStore as a wrapper around CGContextRef. Although
	apparently toll-free bridged under Cocoa just as under Opal, this
	eliminates a compiler warning when setting a context as contents
	of a layer.

	* Source/CARenderer.m:
	GSQuartzCore under Cocoa can now display contents of a layer.

	* Mac/GSQuartzCore-Info.plist:
	* Mac/GSQuartzCore-Prefix.pch:
	* Mac/en.lproj/InfoPlist.strings:
	Added a hack for getting GNUstep's QuartzCore to run under Cocoa
	without conflicting with Cocoa's implementation. Important for
	quickly comparing differences between implementations.

	* Tests/hello.m:
	* Tests/hello_carenderer.m:
	* Tests/main.m:
	Reworked a lot of dependencies to support the GSQuartzCore hack.
	Tests can now run using GSQuartzCore under Cocoa, too. GSQuartzCore
	running under Cocoa currently doesn't read the bitmap data from
	CGContextRef, so layers are empty.

	* Source/CARenderer.m:
	Fixed an incorrect presumption that CGFloat is the same as
	GLfloat.

	* Headers/QuartzCore/CATransaction.h:
	* Source/CATransaction.m:
	Began implementing transactions. This will allow work on animations.

2012-06-18  Ivan Vučica  <ivan@vucica.net>

	* Source/CATransform3D.m:
	Fix of bugs detected by tests: identity matrix was not correctly
	identified, matrix multiplication arguments were not given in correct
	order, rotation matrix was not correctly constructed.
	Fixed order of transform operations when rendering.

	* Tests/CATransform3D/Makefile.mac:
	Renamed previous file which is used for testing on OS X.

	* Tests/Testing.h:
	* Tests/CATransform3D/GNUmakefile:
	* Tests/CATransform3D/run_tests.sh:
	Added support for running the tests under GNUstep.
	
	* .hgignore:
	Added to facilitate easier use with HgSubversion.

	* Tests/hello.m:
	* Tests/hello_carenderer.m:
	Added glFlush() before swapping buffers via -[NSOpenGLContext
	flushBuffer], fixing OS X.

	Xcode project for building Cocoa versions of the demos.

	* Tests/QCTestOpenGLView.m:
	* Tests/hello.m:
	* Tests/hello_carenderer.m:
	Patches for the demos to get them as close to running as
	possible. They're still not rendering anything into the OpenGL
	context, though.
