	* Mac/GSQuartzCore-Info.plist:
	* Mac/GSQuartzCore-Prefix.pch:
	* Mac/en.lproj/InfoPlist.strings:
	Added a hack for getting GNUstep's QuartzCore to run under Cocoa
	without conflicting with Cocoa's implementation. Important for
	quickly comparing differences between implementations.

	* Tests/main.m:
	Reworked a lot of dependencies to support the GSQuartzCore hack.
	Tests can now run using GSQuartzCore under Cocoa, too. GSQuartzCore
	running under Cocoa currently doesn't read the bitmap data from
	CGContextRef, so layers are empty.

	* Source/CARenderer.m:
	Fixed an incorrect presumption that CGFloat is the same as
	GLfloat.

	* Headers/QuartzCore/CATransaction.h:
	* Source/CATransaction.m:
	Began implementing transactions. This will allow work on animations.

	* Source/CATransform3D.m:
	Fix of bugs detected by tests: identity matrix was not correctly
	identified, matrix multiplication arguments were not given in correct
	order, rotation matrix was not correctly constructed.
	Fixed order of transform operations when rendering.

	* Tests/CATransform3D/Makefile.mac:
	Renamed previous file which is used for testing on OS X.

	* Tests/Testing.h:
	* Tests/CATransform3D/GNUmakefile:
	* Tests/CATransform3D/run_tests.sh:
	Added support for running the tests under GNUstep.
	
	* .hgignore:
	Added to facilitate easier use with HgSubversion.

	* Tests/hello.m:
	* Tests/hello_carenderer.m:
	Added glFlush() before swapping buffers via -[NSOpenGLContext
	flushBuffer], fixing OS X.

	Xcode project for building Cocoa versions of the demos.

	* Tests/QCTestOpenGLView.m:
	* Tests/hello.m:
	* Tests/hello_carenderer.m:
	Patches for the demos to get them as close to running as
	possible. They're still not rendering anything into the OpenGL
	context, though.
